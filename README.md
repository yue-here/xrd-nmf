# Using non-negative matrix factorization to extract quantities of different phases during in situ experiments

The notebook is a quick example of using NMF to analyse data from time resolved in situ experiments (useful for synchrotron, neutron or similar).

Code will be added as a module to the cycad library to take advantage of cycad's I/O for XRD data.
